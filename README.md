## Description

A school project i'm sharing on github, for other's research.

I'm in my school's Combat Robotics Club, and have been tasked with making the live-stream look nice and proffesional, thanks to having previous experience with OBS and live-stream production. I made this script to help!

This script has 2 main benefits:

+ A custom UI with the ability to control multiple sources, scenes, and effects more consistently and efficiently than the standard OBS scene/source layout.
+ Very easy to control for someone new to OBS or doesn't know my specific scene setup

## Dependancies:
+ obsws (https://pypi.org/project/obsws-python/)
+ gopro_as_webcam_on_linux (https://github.com/jschmid1/)
