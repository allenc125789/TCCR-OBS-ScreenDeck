## Description

A school project i'm sharing on github.

I'm in my school's Combat Robotics Club, and have been tasked with making the live-stream look nice and proffesional, thanks to having previous experience with OBS and live-stream production.

I took it a few steps up, and scripted my own OBS control panel! This script has 2 main benefits:

:white_check_mark: A custom UI with the ability to control multiple sources, scenes, and effects more consistently and efficiently than the standard OBS scene/source layout.
:white_check_mark: Very easy to control for someone new to OBS or doesn't know my specific scene setup

## Dependancies:
+ obsws (https://pypi.org/project/obsws-python/)
+ gopro_as_webcam_on_linux (https://github.com/jschmid1/)
