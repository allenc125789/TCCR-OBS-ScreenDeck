A school project i'm sharing on github.

I'm in my school's Combat Robotics Club, and have been tasked with making the live-stream look nice and proffesional, thanks to having previous experience with OBS and live-stream production.

I took it a few steps up, and scripted my own OBS control panel! This script has 2 main benefits:

- GUI with the ability to control multiple sources, scenes, and effects more consistently and efficiently than the standard OBS UI.
- Makes it very easy for other's in the group that are new to OBS, or don't know how to work my specific OBS scene setup, to control the livestream.

Dependancies:
+ obsws (https://pypi.org/project/obsws-python/)
+ gopro_as_webcam_on_linux (https://github.com/jschmid1/)
