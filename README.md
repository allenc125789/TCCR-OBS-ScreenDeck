A school project i'm sharing on github.

I'm in my school's Combat Robotics club, and have been tasked with making the live-stream look nice and proffesional because of my previous experience with OBS and live-stream editing. I took it a few steps up, and scripted my own OBS control panel! This gives me a GUI with the ability to control multiple sources, scenes, and effects more effectivley and efficiently than the standard OBS UI.

Dependancies:
+ obsws (https://pypi.org/project/obsws-python/)
+ gopro_as_webcam_on_linux (https://github.com/jschmid1/)

To-Do:
+ Need confirmation before exiting window while live.

+ Need to add a cleanup function for program startup and going live.
