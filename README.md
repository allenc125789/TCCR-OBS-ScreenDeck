## Description

A school project i'm sharing on github.

I'm in my school's Combat Robotics Club, and have been tasked with making the live-stream look nice and professional, thanks to having previous experience with OBS and live-stream production. I made this script to help!

This script has 2 main benefits:

+ A custom UI with the ability to control multiple sources, scenes, and effects more consistently and efficiently than the standard OBS scene/source layout.
+ Very easy to control for someone new to OBS or doesn't know my specific scene setup

## Dependancies:
+ obsws (https://pypi.org/project/obsws-python/)
+ gopro_as_webcam_on_linux (https://github.com/jschmid1/)**[Only needed for Linux]**

## ToDo:

+ Add a match/round counter, one that has 2 buttons, for making the round go up or down, then a third button to hide/show it.

+ Add a name vs name section, with a red and blue bar background, for the bots battling. make a little red and blue pixel bot to put on the either side of it.

+ add transition between cams
